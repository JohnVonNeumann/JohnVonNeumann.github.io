Title: About

I am a human that likes computers. Sometimes, I get computers to do work for me so I don't have to do it ever again. I like Linux and Vim. Currently, I'm trying to be not such a scrub at networking and I'm also working towards being a real sysadmin. Occasionally, I attend conferences.
