> How I got the HTML static site running on Heroku.

## Aim
> I wanted to create a website that could serve as something of a supplement to the rigid nature of linkedin, I wanted it to be a total solution that was super simple yet still looked like it had some level of design. I feel that I was trying to target back end jobs with my website, and felt that getting to the point and elimating complexity in a large way would probably show that I was about the idea of back ending, at least in a superficial fundamental starter way.

## Design Choices
> I chose to go for a simple/brutalist design as I felt it was most honest of myself personally and how I like to present things. I wanted to come up with something that had an element of uniqueness without looking obnoxious and believe I have done so. The idea of going simple pertains to the idea that software development is mainly about eliminating complexitiy, hence adding complexity to my site seemed kinda perverse. I chose to outright avoid javascript use as a personal preference, I use js blocker extensions, and often find that website functionality is disabled to the extreme detriment of UX, and it feels that a lot of the time, content that really shouldn't be blocked is, and that's due to extreme js use. Basically, I'm not gonna ask others to use js on my site when I don't use it on theirs. I also kept it simple because I feel that I have more of an interest in back end and wanted to keep my website looking clean yet easily managed/updated. I basically didn't want things breaking and it taking me ages to fix it.

## Avoidance of certain things
> I haven't created a resume link or download as I felt that the website and links to linkedin would suffice. Resumes feel dated to me and they go out of date faster than new cars lose value after driving out of the dealership.

## Explanation for the walls of text
>tl;dr, cliffs, OP is a douchebag
Although general advice and thought process suggest not to make a gigantic monologue, I decided that if you're on my website, you're not here to watch youtube videos, you're here to read about me as you're either hiring me or stalking me, either way, you want info and I can give it to you. I can appreciate keeping it brief, but one of the teachers said that a website was no place to be modest, I took the advice to heart. I also felt somewhat trapped as I don't use social media due to personal preference,

## Intial Design

## Process
> I went through a few stages with this website, they included using figma to map the design, trying a template, scrapping the template, deciding to use bootstrap, scrapping bootstrap, deciding that writing pure html/css wasn't for me, deciding to use bootstrap, then ultimately iterating to final output.
