          <p> Previous to work in development, I worked in the construction industry installing expansion joints and waterproofing. I decided to make the switch after realising I was ready for the next phase of my personal development; and after 8 years working in construction, felt that a hands on occupation would best suit my interests and accumulated workplace skills and knowledge.

            <p> I would make a great addition to a workplace as I enjoy seeking out new knowledge and have a proactive approach towards personal education. I enjoy reading on a variety of topics, however, more recently I have heavily slanted my reading adventures towards technical books in order to further my skills and knowledge of the software development cycle. <br> I believe that my time spent in construction would provide enormous benefits to my employer, as all this time was spent working next to the business owner; my Father. I’m not sure if employers attach much weight to this and to be fair I have often wondered if admitting that my entire working career thusfar has been within the “comfort” of my Father’s business. However, I honestly believe that this work has been the most legitimate work experience I could ever get. I have seen first-hand the ups and downs of smallbusiness ownership. I have been present during negotiations and have seen the inner workings of business decision making. I have seen the lengths that businesses sometimes must go in order to keep the client satisfied and happy. I understand the importance of strong project management and good company culture. I have even had to manage employees, which to me is true baptism by fire. <br> This probably all sounds rather cliché, but I am proud of the work I have done with my Father and honestly believe it to be one of the best things that has ever happened to me. And now I would like to take that experience and use it to help another business owner grow their own operations.

            <h2><i class="material-icons"> account_circle </i> About </h2>
            <p>I am currently focusing my attention on data-driven/centric development, with a large portion of my time going into Machine Learning and improving my knowledge of scientific/numerical languages like Python and R. I also continue to improve my knowledge of web development with Django and Shiny. I am currently studying towards an Associate Developer certification with AWS and have good knowledge of Docker and other DevOps tools. I am constantly improving via rigorous and relentless self-education and practical development projects.<br>
            I am interested in startup culture and the environment it provides, I engaged in a 6 week internship with an InfoSec focused startup where I performed a range of tasks ranging from user support, bug testing, documentation creation, deployment and Pentesting.

            <p> I like to read on a a lot of varying topics, both from books and blogs. In recent months I have been mainly focused on technical know-how, so this has influenced my reading habits considerably. Some of the topics I enjoy reading, include: technology, science, business, personal development, performance/attention psychology and mathematics. <br> Musically, I'm learning to play the piano and enjoy all types of music, I have been finding myself leaning more towards instrumental recently. As it provides a less intrusive form of entertainment, especially with development, moreso background music than anything else. <br> I also like investing, mainly in small cap, early-stage companies.
